# Welcome to the Mackenzie.TechDocs Project!
This is my technical writing website, which was made with MkDocs. 


Some facts about this site:
* It utilizes ``Markdown``, ``CSS``, ``HTML``, ``JavaScript``, and ``YAML``!
* It is where you can find some of my work.
* It has a blog, which I hope to update (semi) frequently.
* It is where you can find links to other places I hang out online.
* It is a **huge** labor of love!

Below, you can see the way the site is organized.
