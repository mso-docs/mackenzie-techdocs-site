A place where I talk about documentation from time to time. 


## 🐾 Fetching the Basics: How to Start Writing Developer Docs

So, you’re a new pup in the pack — excited, curious, maybe a little overwhelmed by the scent of APIs, version control, and the mysterious ways of software engineers. Don’t worry. Whether you're fresh to technical writing or just shifting from end-user guides to dev-focused content, this guide is your leash and compass.

Let’s go for a walk through the essentials of writing developer documentation — without getting tangled in the code.

---

### 🦴 What *Is* Developer Documentation?

``Developer documentation`` is content that helps developers understand, use, integrate, or contribute to a product — usually software or APIs. It might include:

- **API references**
- **SDK guides**
- **Integration tutorials**
- **Authentication walkthroughs**
- **Code examples & use cases**
- **System architecture overviews**

The tone tends to be factual, concise, and code-literate — but don’t mistake that for dry or robotic. Great dev docs are just as readable and helpful as any other kind of writing — maybe more so.

---

### 🐶 Know Your Audience: The Dev Pack

Before you start barking commands, sniff out who your readers are:

- Are they **frontend developers**, **DevOps engineers**, or **full-stack generalists**?
- Do they want **quick start access**, or are they digging in for a long **integration journey**?
- Are they **experienced coders**, or are you writing for **partners and product managers** too?

>💡 **Tip:** The best way to learn is to *ask a developer*. If you’re on a team, shadow a sprint or pair with an engineer for a day. If not, read Stack Overflow threads about your product — you’ll quickly smell out the pain points.

---

#### 🐾 Step-by-Step: How to Get Started

##### **1. Sit. Stay. Read the Codebase (Or Ask About It)**
You don’t need to understand every line, but you *do* need to know what’s exposed, what’s configurable, and what needs to be documented. Use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI or Postman to explore APIs.

🐕‍🦺 *Pro Move*: Request a developer walkthrough of a typical use case.

---

##### **2. Fetch the Essentials: Start with a Quickstart**
A good quickstart is like a tennis ball: it gets the action going. Make sure it includes:

- Setup requirements (API keys, environments)
- Install commands
- One real-world example
- A working output

>⚠️ **WARNING:** *Avoid hello-world fluff*. Show users something they can **actually** build.

---

##### **3. Leash It to the Source of Truth**
Docs get out of date *fast*. Hook your documentation process into the dev pipeline:

- Use Git for version control.
- Add doc tickets to sprints.
- Comment your code with tools like JSDoc, Docstrings, or Sphinx.

🐾 *Bonus*: Learn how to generate docs from code using tools like Docusaurus, Jekyll, or Docsify.

---

##### **4. Mind the Command Tone**
Developers like clear, imperative instructions. Use:

✅ "Run this command"  
✅ "Authenticate using your API key"  
❌ "One might consider using..."

Keep your barks short, sharp, and polite.

---

##### **5. Treats Matter: Give Examples**
No one likes abstract barking. Always include:

- Code snippets
- Sample responses (JSON, XML, etc.)
- Common errors & fixes

💬 **Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mackenzie.techdocs/dogs \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
-d '{"breed":"Retriever","task":"Fetch"}'
```

---

#### 🐾 Final Treats: Tools of the Trade

| Tool        | What It’s Good For             |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **Postman** | API exploration                |
| **Swagger** | API docs & sandboxing          |
| **Docsify** | Simple static doc sites        |
| **Markdown**| Lightweight writing & formatting |
| **Git/GitHub**| Version control + feedback loop |

---

### 🐕 Wrap-Up: You’re Ready to Roll Over and Write

Developer documentation can feel intimidating at first — but once you learn the signals, follow the trail, and reward your readers with clarity, it becomes one of the most rewarding types of writing around.

And hey — if you mess up? Just shake it off and try again. Even senior tech writers have chewed a wire or two.

---
## 🐾 Sit, Stay, Explain: Writing Docs with Command Clarity

Writing for developers isn’t about flowery prose — it’s about precision, direction, and getting your reader from A to B *without sniffing a dozen wrong trees on the way*.

Think of your documentation like obedience training: developers want clear commands, immediate feedback, and no surprises. So let’s leash up the fluff and walk through how to write with **command clarity**.

---

### 🦴 Why Command Clarity Matters

In a developer’s world:
- Ambiguity = bugs
- Passive voice = confusion
- Over-explaining = wasted time

Clarity is kindness. When someone is following your guide under time pressure, your words become their internal voice. You want to sound like a guide dog, not a confused poodle.

---

### 🐶 Sit: Use Imperatives for Instructions

Good developer docs **tell**, they don’t **suggest**.

✅ **Do this**:  
> *Run `npm install` to install dependencies.*

❌ **Not this**:  
> *You might want to consider running `npm install`.*

The command tone removes doubt. If there’s a reason not to do something, say so. Otherwise, lead confidently.

---

### 🐕 Stay: Avoid Wandering Into Unclear Language

Here’s a rule of paw: **Every word should serve the task.** Avoid hedging or filler like:

- “Just”
- “Simply”
- “Hopefully”
- “Basically”
- “It should work…”

💬 Instead of:
> *You just need to add a line to the config file and hopefully that should do it.*

🎯 Say:
> *Add the following line to `config.yaml`:*

---

### 🐾 Heel: Keep Sentence Structure Predictable

Developers skim. Help them stay on the trail with:

- **Short sentences** (aim for ~15 words)
- **Parallel structure** in lists
- **Consistent phrasing** for repeated actions

🐾 *Example*:
> 1. Clone the repo.  
> 2. Install dependencies.  
> 3. Run the local server.  

That’s easier to follow than:
> 1. Start by cloning the repo.  
> 2. After that, install what you need.  
> 3. Finally, boot it up locally.

---

### 🐩 Fetch: Show, Don’t Just Tell

Whenever possible, **include examples** right after your instruction. Bonus points for:

- Sample output
- Before-and-after comparisons
- Code snippets with syntax highlighting

```bash
# Good
curl -X POST https://api.mackenzie.techdocs/fetch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"task":"fetch","object":"stick"}'

```

> 📎**TIP:** Don’t assume they’ll guess the syntax — fetch it for them.

---

### 🐕‍🦺 Trust Signals: Use Consistent Terminology

Don’t call it “the control panel” in one step and “the dashboard” in another. Pick a term and stick to it. This builds **trust and navigability**.

📏 Use style guides (like [Google’s Developer Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style)) to stay on-leash with industry norms.

---

### 🦮 Speak Clearly, Even to the Alpha Devs

Some folks think clear, step-by-step docs are “dumbing things down.”

That’s nonsense.

Even seasoned devs appreciate concise, well-structured instructions. Clarity isn’t about simplification — it’s about **respect**.

---

### 🧼 Grooming the Final Draft

Before you publish:

* Remove filler words
* Use consistent formatting (headers, code blocks, etc.)
* Test your steps in a fresh environment
* Ask a peer to follow it *without talking to you*

If they get stuck, the doc failed — not the reader.

---

### 🐕 Wrap-Up: Clear Docs Are Loyal Companions

When your docs speak with command clarity, developers follow with confidence. Your words become their tools — no growling, no second-guessing, just reliable guidance that helps them fetch results.

So sit. Stay. Explain.

And most of all? Keep writing like someone’s success depends on it — because it does.

---

## 🦴 Treat-Driven Development: Incentivizing Quality Docs

Good documentation doesn’t magically appear. It takes time, empathy, and collaboration between humans (and sometimes dogs) who would often rather be coding. So how do you encourage a team to take documentation seriously — not as a chore, but as a core part of the product?

Welcome to **Treat-Driven Development**, where incentives, recognition, and thoughtful structure help create a doc culture that sticks.

---

### 🐕 What Is Treat-Driven Development?

Treat-Driven Development (TDD) is a play on “Test-Driven Development,” but instead of writing tests first, we’re building a system that rewards and reinforces good documentation habits.

Think of it like training your team: instead of growling when someone forgets to document, give them a treat when they do it right.

---

#### 🍖 The Problem: Why Docs Often Get Ignored

- Docs aren’t tied to success metrics
- Writers are outnumbered and overwhelmed
- Devs don’t see immediate value in writing docs
- No feedback loop to validate documentation quality
- Docs rot over time if no one owns them

The result? Guides that are outdated, shallow, or missing entirely — even in otherwise brilliant codebases.

---

### 🐾 The Treats: How to Incentivize Better Docs

Here’s how you build a doc culture without barking orders:

#### ✅ 1. Make Docs Part of “Definition of Done”

Add documentation requirements directly into your PR checklist or sprint board:

- [ ] Feature has updated user-facing documentation
- [ ] Internal notes or dev guides are current
* [ ] API changes include updated examples

🐶 *Docs aren't optional — they’re part of finishing the work.*

---

#### 💬 2. Give Positive Reinforcement

Celebrate docs in standups, retros, or Slack:

- “Huge shoutout to Sam for writing that onboarding guide — it saved us hours!”
- “This doc rewrite helped three new users succeed this week!”

🍪 Use emojis, GIFs, or even actual snacks if you're on-site. Positive attention goes a long way.

---

#### 🏅 3. Reward Contributions

Create incentives for solid doc work:

- Highlight “Doc of the Month” in your internal newsletter
- Award badges/stickers/virtual medals to contributors
- Tie doc ownership to internal recognition systems

🐾 You’d be surprised how much a silly paw-print trophy can boost morale.

---

#### 🧠 4. Train Devs to Be Doc-Friendly

Not every developer needs to be a novelist — but they *can* learn to:

- Add meaningful code comments
- Write usage examples in PRs
- Keep README.md files current

📚 Offer a 20-minute “Docs 101” lunch-and-learn or share a guide like “How to Write Dev Docs Without Hating It.”

---

#### 🔄 5. Close the Feedback Loop

Let writers and devs know when docs are working:

- Share real user quotes (“I followed the tutorial and it just worked!”)
- Track support ticket reductions post-doc update
- Monitor doc usage analytics

🐕 Treat: Give credit *back* to the person who improved the doc.

---

### 📏 Tools to Help You Reward Docs

| Tool            | Use Case                                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| GitHub PR templates | Require doc updates in code reviews     |
| ReadMe / Stoplight | Add user ratings or comments on docs     |
| Slack/Discord bots | Auto-shoutout contributors to #docs      |
| Google Forms      | Collect internal votes for doc MVPs       |

---

### 🐕 Wrap-Up: Create a Culture of Documentation Delight

Treat-Driven Development isn’t about bribery — it’s about reinforcing a shared value: **docs matter**.

When you reward good documentation with praise, visibility, and small wins, you build a team that sees writing as part of shipping. And that, friend, is how you raise a loyal, productive doc culture that wags its tail with pride.

Now go give someone a treat.

## Dog-Eared Docs: When and How to Archive Old Content

Every tech writer has come across them — old, dusty documentation pages that haven’t seen a pawprint in years. They lurk in sidebars, mislead users, and haunt support teams. These are your **stale docs**, and if you don’t manage them, they’ll dig holes in your documentation strategy.

Let’s sniff out how to recognize, handle, and gracefully retire outdated content — without upsetting the whole pack.

---

### 🐕 What Are “Dog-Eared” Docs?

Dog-eared docs are:
- Outdated guides referencing deprecated features
- Old APIs no longer in use
- Tutorials for workflows that no longer apply
- Articles with broken links, screenshots, or commands

They might not bark, but they bite — especially when a user follows them and ends up completely lost.

---

### 🦴 Why Managing Stale Docs Matters

Letting old docs sit around isn’t harmless. It leads to:

- 🚨 **Confusion**: Users follow old steps and hit errors
- 🐢 **Support load**: Devs and support teams get repetitive questions
- 🧱 **Clutter**: New content gets buried in outdated cruft
- 😕 **Brand erosion**: Docs that feel abandoned make the product look abandoned

Managing stale docs is part janitorial, part curation, and part detective work.

---

### 🐾 Signs a Doc Needs Retiring

Sniff out the following:

| Sign                        | What It Means                                   |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Last updated > 12 months    | It may be obsolete or in need of review         |
| Refers to deprecated APIs   | Misleads users and causes frustration            |
| Has “Coming Soon” content   | Someone forgot to clean up                      |
| High bounce rate (analytics)| People are finding it, but leaving confused     |
| Internal SME says “Huh?”    | The content is likely out of sync with reality  |

---

### 🐶 Audit Your Kennel Regularly

A good practice is to **audit your documentation set** every 3–6 months.

You can:
- Export a list of pages with last modified dates
- Track analytics to see usage and drop-offs
- Ask product owners or devs to flag outdated content

💡 **Pro tip**: Create a stale doc dashboard or spreadsheet to track status, review dates, and action plans.

---

### 🐩 What to Do With Old Docs

Once you identify the stale stuff, here’s your action plan:

#### ✅ Update It
If the content is still relevant but outdated, revise it:
- Add current screenshots or CLI output
- Remove deprecated flags or parameters
- Clarify confusing language

#### 📦 Archive It
If it’s obsolete but still *historically relevant*, move it:
- Add a banner: `⚠️ This doc refers to version 1.x, which is no longer supported`
- Move it to an “Archive” section
- Remove from nav/search results if possible

#### 🗑️ Retire It
If it’s completely useless:
- Remove it from the repo or CMS
- Set up redirects (for static sites)
- Log the removal in changelogs or commit history

---

### 🦮 Train Your Team to Avoid Staleness

Teach your whole pack to help prevent stale docs:

- Link code changes to doc updates in your PR process
- Use versioning (e.g., `/v1/`, `/v2/`) to isolate legacy content
- Encourage doc ownership within dev teams

🐾 *Make doc freshness part of the sprint*, not an afterthought.

---

### 📏 Tools to Help You Track Aging Content

| Tool            | Use Case                                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| GitHub Actions   | Flag old Markdown files via script       |
| Google Analytics | Track bounce rates, page views, exits    |
| Read the Docs    | Supports versioned content out of the box |
| Docsify / Docusaurus | Add custom banners to legacy pages     |

---

### 🐕 Wrap-Up: Don’t Let Old Docs Bite Back

Documentation isn’t a write-it-once-and-walk-away job. Like dogs, it needs grooming, feeding, and a bit of discipline now and then.

By identifying and managing stale docs, you create a cleaner, safer, and more useful experience for every developer who sniffs around your product.

So check your shelves. You might just find a few dog-eared pages waiting for a new leash on life.
